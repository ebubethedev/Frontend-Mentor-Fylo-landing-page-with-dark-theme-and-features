### What I learned

I learned to impelent css grid in my code for better layout and responsiveness. This project enabled me to implement css grid.

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 3px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 40px auto 40px;
  grid-template-areas: "h h h h h h h h h h h h " "s s s s s s s s s s s s " "f f f f f f f f f f f f ";
}
```
